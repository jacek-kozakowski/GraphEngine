# Graph Engine

Graph Engine is an efficient C++ library designed for graph operations, featuring fundamental search and optimization algorithms along with custom-built data structures.

## Features

- **Graph Algorithms:**
  - **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** Traverses the graph level by level.
  - **DFS (Depth-First Search):** Traverses the graph depth-first.
  - **Dijkstra:** Computes the shortest paths in a weighted graph.
  - **Prim:** Constructs the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
- **Custom Data Structures:**
  - Implementation of `Queue` and `Stack`.
  - Implementation of `MinHeap` used in optimization algorithms.
- **IO System:** Loading graphs from text files.
